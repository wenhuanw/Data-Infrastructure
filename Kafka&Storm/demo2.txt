! Monday Funday recovery drinks all day...!!	^^5^1^0
! had lunch here with a couple of fellow yelpers  and we all had a great lunch.I had the Pulled pork sandwich (good), waffle fries (real good) and the baked beans (great) . Everything was pretty good the only thing I can really complain about is my pulled pork sandwich would have been better if the bun was thrown on the grill for a minute to warm it up and toast the buttered side. That would have gotten them the fifth star. I am sure they will get it the next time I go there because a girl at the next table got B.B.Q. chicken and it looked awesome, I thought I should have ordered that, next time I will try the chicken and I am sure they will get 5 stars.	^^4^1^0
!!! ~ CASH ONLY ~ !!!~~This place is an absolute HOLE IN THE WALL - but in the good kind of way.  There is no diet menu here.  The Chuck Box is for Carnivores!~~Very casual, very open, great outside seating and perfect atmosphere.  they sell beer to help wash down your tasty burger.  I'm hooked!~~Parking is limited and the lunch crowd borders on almost our of control.  Get there early!	^^4^1^0
!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!~~My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!~~Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!~~Here's what we had:~~~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.~~~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado, ~~~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.	^^5^1^0
!!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D~Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try!	^^5^1^0
" Would you like more butter with that?" Those were the actual words that melted my heart, never having heard a server ask me this in my entire restaurant-going life. 5 stars for that . Still, amazingly enough my answer was no, because this is the kind of place that provides a generous number of salted butter pats with the indulgent chocolate mousse muffin.~I have had breakfast here twice and love the over-the-top muffin with breakfast deal here. It's like two breakfasts in one - a large desert-style muffins with the bacon, breakfast potatos and eggs thing.  Does anyone really need it? Of course not. I kept chanting under my breath, I am not going to eat this whole sticky, frosted muffin...until it was gone. ~And who can resist the totally wholesome servers who, without a trace of irony, greet you with a perky "Bonjour!" Although this is listed as an "American" restaurant, they definitely are trying for some kind of French thing, what with brioche and all. Hard to beat for a breakfast that lasts all day, when you can't decide to go sweet or savory and friendly, efficient service.	^^4^1^0
"$20 a month. No Gimmicks, no contracts." Great. Where do I sign up? "Oh yeah, there is a $49 sign up fee." Ok. That's pretty standard for a gym. "Ooooh, I forgot, there is a $39 annual fee." Hmmm, ok, I'll still sign up (swipes card). Where do I register for the spinning class? "About that, you don't have access to the group classes unless you upgrade your membership." GODDAMUSOMUCH You didn't tell me that before I paid.~~(EDIT) Upgraded to three stars for reaching out and making it right. Thank you.	^^3^0^1
".....on one hand, I'll be dressed well.  On the other hand, my bank account will suffer."  These were exactly my thoughts when I realized there was a Ted Baker less than 10 minutes from my new home.~~While Burberry and Paul Smith may get all the press amongst British Designers, for my long/thin body type the only clothing I've found that fits better and lasts longer than Ted Baker is Armani and considering the price difference I could buy 2-3 Ted Baker Archive Shirts for the price of one from Armani.  ~~While I must say I wish Ted's Mens Shoes were a little more comfortable that is a small quibble when everything else fits so well and the sales are frequently so good.  I see a lot of this store in my future.	^^5^1^0
"....they need more meats on a stick..." - Ben Stiller as Ted in There's Something About Mary.~~I think he meant they need more gauchos running around in a restaurant slicing it up for me to indulge in.  ~~I brought a friend here for dinner.  He had never had the churrascaria experience so I thought I would help him improve his dining experience exponentially.~~The first great thing, apart from the food, was the parking set up.  There's complimentary valet parking OR your friend can park a 100 yds away from the front door so he can laugh at you while you negotiate beds of tiny rocks in your stilettos.  Anyway, this location is soooo much better than the Beverly Hills one that has super atrocious parking.~~To the good stuff....I made my friend order a caipirinah and I ordered a Mondavi Pinot Noir to start.  We hit the salad bar and my friend was like what is all this weird stuff.  Who cares, just dump ranch on it!  They had a really yummy apple salad that I had never tried before, but I like to load up on the hearts of palm, artichokes, and buffalo mozzarella.~~Along with never having had the Brazilian experience, my friend had never had filet mignon....smh...you poor sheltered thing.  He tried the bacon wrapped filet & chicken first.  I watched him de-virginize his mouth with filet mignon.  It was pornographic.  Then we tried MY personal fave, lamb chops medium rare.  I also had the bottom sirloin which was a little too skirty for my liking.~~Oh, this kid also tried his first bite of polenta....christ almighty...and he liked.~~We finished off dinner with the papaya cream dessert, which was papaya blended w/ vanilla ice cream topped w/ creme de cassis, and 2 snifters of B & B.~~Oh, you've never had B & B?  Kiss the enamel on your teeth goodbye, but it tastes absolutely delish!~~We had phenomenal service at a great price.  I got more bang for my buck here at this location.  What I spent here on the AYCA, dessert, & booze was equal to the cost of the AYCE only price at the BH locale.  (What's the exchange rate of the Cali $ to the AZ $....3 to 1?  I love it!)~~For a casual yet buzzing dining experience, bring your self-proclaimed sheltered friends here for a meaty, treaty taste fest, flip to green and it's on!	^^5^1^0
"...probably the best gourmet burger I have ever tasted..." with technopop  blasting in the background~~Fez is somewhat unique for Phoenix. Bravely occupying its own building, nestled between a FedEx and roaring choppers on Central Ave, it strives for identity amid strip mall chain cuisine. ~~I arrived early to meet a friend for dinner, and was immediately made welcome and gratefully seated without question. I took in the crowd and was pleased to see more diversity than I expected: young & hip, middle aged & professional, gay & straight, groups & couples. The decore was urban and sleek, but admittedly a little sterile for my taste.  The room a little too dark and the technopop too loud. Outside wasn't much better, with the roaring street traffic noise of motorcycles. I opted to stay inside, and made the mental note that this restaurant might be fun for a group or a casual meal, but would be off my list for a romantic evening. My friend arrived, and we got down to the business of ordering.~~We started with the fez lettuce wraps. A refreshing chopped salad of dried fruit, tender chicken , and pomegranate vinaigrette served on surprisingly hearty romaine leaves.  The crispness of the romaine balanced the chewy texture of the dried fruit, but was not overpowering. The perfect starter for what was to come.~~I chose the Fez burger, medium rare, with sweet potato fries and a rather expensive glass of Cabernet to wash it down. The burger arrived a little too fast from the kitchen, as we were finishing up our romaine wraps. I took a moment to look it over. Boldly cut in half, to display that it was, indeed, grilled to medium rare perfection. Astonishingly neatly assembled layers of cinnamon pears, feta cheese, crispy onions, on freshly toasted ciabatta bread. I picked up the larger half, and bit into what is probably the best gourmet burger I have ever tasted.~~Smoky, sweet, rich, tangy - I could taste everything separately, but it somehow all worked together into something fresh and exciting. This burger was complex, and I could appreciate that someone had worked very, very hard to create this little masterpiece of flavor and texture. I won't say anything more about that burger, as I don't want to ruin the surprise, but let's just say that as I ate it, I couldn't imagine how it could be any better than it was. My sweet potatoes fries were sweet and crunchy, every calorie well worth it. My wine smooth with a big finish, worth the splurge.~~It wasn't until I'd finished my wine, that I realized that my waitress had been disappointingly absent. Although I prefer unobtrusive service and was secretly glad to not have to deal with the burden of perkiness, a little more attention would have been nice. Once my meal was done, I was brought back down to my hard-edged, smooth surfaced surroundings,  and remembered that somewhere I had eaten that exotic, sophisticated, absolutely delectable burger, but couldn't reconcile it with my environment. ~~Fez will most likely become a regular haunt of mine - I can't imagine how I could keep away from those burgers, now that I've had my first taste. Next time, though, I might try either sitting outside, or kicking up my drinks a notch, to make myself a bit numb to the surroundings.	^^4^1^0
"2 stars for disappointing food, one star for great service."~~Had I read Iain B's review prior to my dinner at Desert Jade the other night, I could've saved us $46.  ~~Instead, my husband and future yelper sister Alexa M and I headed down Indian School road in search for some decent Chinese food.  We were all pretty hungry and it was my bright idea to try a new place.  We passed by Shanghai Chinese and actually pulled into the parking lot of another restaurant (maybe China Village?) but decided since the parking lot was close to empty, that was not a good sign.  So, somehow we ended up at Desert Jade.~~Ivan was our server and he was fantastic.  I just wish I could say the same about the food... ~~Unfortunately, the egg drop soup, Kung Pao Vegetables, Spicy Chicken, and Beef and Asparagus dishes were nothing to write home about... all were mediocre.~~Next time, I'll go to one of our regular spots instead... or at the very least, I'll check the Yelp reviews before wasting time and money.  You live and learn... they cannot all compete with Tottie's or Jade Palace!	^^3^0^1
"6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles".~~Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.	^^4^1^0
"A Beauty Apothecary": Luxury Cosmetics, Skin Care, Bath + Body, Makeup Services, Brows, Eyelash extensions...~~I ventured into this tiny Beauty Apothecary some time ago, and fell in love with this small boutique.  It is a one of a kind here in Scottsdale and carries lines such as Kevin Aucoin...I like going there because I have finally found a GREAT aesthetician...her name is Leah Alvarez and I highly recommend her for any waxing services (especially the brow!) she also provides facials and other services. ~~The Glam Lounge as provides makeup services buy Andrea...she is genius when doing makeup!~~I highly recommend this Beauty Apothecary boutique for any of the ladies out there!	^^5^1^0
"A Good Place To Day Drink" as their motto goes, and never look back.~~A popular destination for locals and visitors for spring training games, you'll always find the place crowded. The place is mostly outdoors so not the best place in a rain storm. The giant game of Jenga, made with 2 by 4 pieces of wood is very entertaining with drunk people playing. The food is pretty good. The nachos always hit the spot especially after you've been drinking. It's not the classiest place in Scottsdale, but its a good place to go and have fun with your friends.~~Dos Gringos is always part of the Scottsdale Block Party during New Years, so when that time of the year comes around, it is an affordable and fun choice.	^^4^1^0
"A good old Bar"~Old Town is the location of the original Dos Gringos.  Known for a at home feeling Dos provides great bartenders and a friendly staff.  I go to Dos often especially to feel comfortable with a hooded sweatshirt in Scottsdale, its that kind of place.  The music is great is diverse from hip hop to rock and roll.  ~~Drinks:~Dos is known for Coronas, they promote awesome specials for Thursday, and when it rains Dos offers cheap drinks. ~~Food,~I enjoy the prices of the late night menu, they cook until 2AM, nice.~My favorite is the hard shell tacos, a former employee suggested them, I think their great for a small snack at the bar.	^^4^1^0
"A steak so tender you can cut it with a butter knife...."~~Ummm, yeah, me thinks not. ~~Here's the dealio. I am an avid red meat and steak consumer. I can't live without a good dose of meat in me each week...wait, what....yeah, so bearing that in mind, when I came to Phoenix for this work trip, I knew I wanted to have a steak and a nice glass of spicy red wine at some point and so we came here since it was right near the bar we were at earlier. ~~As soon as we walked in I dug the place. The decor is pretty elaborate and it's easily a million dollar design. Even the bathrooms look like spreads in design mags and with the high ceilings and intimate lighting, it's a home run visually.~~After waiting about, oh 20 minutes, we were seated at a table and we all perused the menu. There were quite a few goodies that looked yummy, but my heart and stubborn mind was on steak and a medium rare one at that! I also wanted to try a salad, cuz I was starving and so I ordered the Caesar along with my Rib Eye.~~The Caesar was okay at best. It definitely skimped on the dressing, so if you like your Caesar salad, Caesary, then maybe order a side of dressing as well. Then there's the rib-eye. A magnificent looking piece of meat it was, but what did they give me to devour it with? ~~You guessed it, a butter knife.~~Really?~~Really.~~What in the Backstreet Boy Hell kinda bullsh*t is that? I probably wouldn't have given the tenderness factor a second thought had it not been for the struggle to cut it with the wrong utensil. And it wasn't an oversight either, this is what they intentionally give you to tackle your dinner with.~~La-me.~~I enjoyed my meal and the steak was tasty, but please, do yourselves a favor and upgrade to steak knives, because it's not tender enough to slice a dull blade through.	^^3^0^1
"A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?"  ~~ Albert Einstein ~~A dizzying array of over 10,000 musical instruments from every nook and cranny of planet Earth. It's a time machine of everything with a beat, a chord or a note. Entering the year-old museum you equip yourself with a set of headphones and a device that matches the video which plays most of the displays throughout the building without ever having to touch a button. ~~After the four hours we'd allotted to tour the museum, I felt reluctant to leave having seen only two thirds of the vast displays arranged by country, musical genre, instrument class or specific artist. A stop at the end of the day was far too short in the area where you can try your hand at playing any of the dozens of instruments in the room from giant gongs to instruments you've never seen before. A particular highlight for me was a large display on the step-by-step creation of a Steinway and Sons grand piano. ~~Highly (highly!) recommended.	^^5^1^0
"A taste of pure enchantment" - this is the tagline for Fairytale Brownies, and I totally agree with it!~~I'd seen Fairytale Brownies at events before but I don't think I ever sampled them... until recently that is, when a beautiful package was delivered to my home as a gift.  I figured it was as good a time as any to forget about my diet and give in and sample these things that fairytales are made of!~~Luckily, it was the Fairtytale Sprites (smaller size brownies) so I didn't feel so guilty afterward.  It was totally worth it!  I have to admit, I actually sampled more than just one... my favorite flavors were the toffee crunch  and caramel flavors.  I have yet to try peanut butter, rasberry swirl, and white chocolate which all sound great too.  Fairytale Wishes (all-natural gourmet soft caramels) were also included in the package, and they were like magic in my mouth - yum!~~I totally recommend sending Fairytale Brownies if you're ever in need of a gift - they really are 'a taste of pure enchantment.'  In addition, the recipient can put them in the refrigerator or freezer to keep these goodies fresh - when ready to eat, just remove wrapper and pop in the microwave... as a matter of fact, I think we still may have some in our freezer - snack time!	^^5^1^0
"A" Mountain is a favorite of mine. My husband and I have been hiking it a couple of times every month for the last few years. I call it efficient! The steep walkways make the short trails a quick, but vigorous workout. The view at the top is a nice reward for the effort. We usually hike down toward the light rail station and cut back through Mill Avenue for an urban walk to finish our outing. Or, if we are more ambitious, we walk around Tempe Town Lake afterward.	^^5^1^0
"A-OK" describes my feelings for Yard House fairly well during their late night happy hour, though it lacks a bit of enthusiasm that my brain interjects into the phrase.  It's probably a wobbly 2.5 stars. Walking in for the first time, I cringed.  Walking in on my second visit resulted in the same unconscious reaction.~~The booths are huge.   Mammoth.  Think "I could crowd the entire Brady Bunch into this booth and still have room for the Partridge Family" huge.  Apparently these tables are necessary for the giant crowds of sports fans they receive, but when it's two people swimming in this gigantic space, it feels a bit awkward.~~They offer four types of cider -- Wyder's Peach, Pear, and Raspberry, and Woodchuck Apple.  I'm not a fan of Wyder's, at all, but it's definitely better on draft and the pear is a decent option.  Woodchuck draft is always a good choice if you enjoy the sweeter type, however, I'd certainly prefer pear to apple.  Regardless: $3.50 during happy hour, and it's hard to find a better price than that.~~I've never tried any of the entrees, but the half priced appetizers (almost reasonably priced for the quality!) have been pretty good.  The sauce on the Jamaican chicken wings gets a thumbs up, the pizza was much better than anticipated, and I definitely enjoyed the chicken lettuce wraps.~~I doubt I'll ever feel comfortable here, but it's certainly a place I would return during the right hour of the day if invited by good company.~~Side note: Who is answering the "Alcohol?" question on the survey as "None"?  Twelve people have given this response.  Don't you realize that we're living in a post-ironic era?	^^3^0^1
"A-OK". That describes fairly accurately my experience here. I imagine if I had gone for the teppanyaki I would have a higher rating, but I was in the mood for sushi.~~Unfortunately, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. The fish was nice and fresh, although not the best I've had. And there was a strange spice on the white fish that I found quite surprising. Not necessarily bad, but it seemed out of place. The tako salad was quite tasty, although it was absolutely drowned in ponzu sauce, so beware!~~Overall, I wouldn't consider this as a "destination" to go back to; however, I wouldn't say no if I were invited to go eat here again.	^^3^0^1
